# Unified Notes for DevOps

- This repository contains unified notes for various DevOps topics, including Docker and Kubernetes. The notes are organized into separate markdown files for each topic, with detailed explanations and summaries based on the original content from TechWorld with Nana's YouTube playlist - which I'm using as a primary source for learning.
- I've made this repository so that I can refer back to anything which I learnt from the videos or any place, and I'm making this repository public so that anyone can refer to it and learn from it as well. The notes are structured in a way that they can be easily navigated and understood, with clear headings and bullet points for key concepts.

## Topics

- [Docker](Docker-notes.md)
- [Kubernetes](Kubernetes-notes.md)
